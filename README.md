#**Overview of Analysis**

This is an Analysis of the CitiBike business model in NYC to determine if the model would be viable in the city of Des Moines, Iowa. Citibike data includes invividual trips for the month, including the gender of the user, the start and end location of the trip by coordinates, the start and end time and trip duration, as well as information on whether the customer is a subscriber to the network.

##**Results**
Analysis of August 2019 data shows several clear findings:

The majority of trips are of short duration, with most lasting around 5 minutes and use dropping significantly around the 30 minute mark

Citibike users are more generally younger, meaning birth year was in the late 1990s to 2000s, although there are some significant outliers in earlier birth years.

Traditional 'commute times' dominate usage timeframes during the weekdays; Monday-Friday. While weekend usage rates tend to peak from 10 AM- 5 PM, suggesting more leisurely recreational bike rides during the weekend days.

These same timeframes show as well that our male users are our predominate user base. Male users tend to follow the same general riding patterns as female, and iunknown gendered users.

It seems that the burrough of Manhattan experiences the most usage of all the burroughs in New York City, suggesting that most users see it as an alternative form of transportation from other things like using the Subways, buses, and taxis.

Subscribers make up the vast majority of Citibike users and tend to use it most during the weekdays, furhter illustring the point that most users see the system as a mode of transportation to and from their place of work, or usual weekday pit stops. On the other hand 'Customers' or non-subscribers tend to use the services more on weekends. Perhaps they are tourists on visits to landmarks or prefer more leisurely bike trips.

Making up more than 81% of the usage base Subscribers are clearly the backbone of the bikesharing business model in New York City.

#**Summary**

        During August 2019 Citibike usage was vastly more popular among subscribers, making up over 81% of the total usage. Additionally male users seemed to use the services more than there other gendered counterparts. Timeframes of usage were higher most always during 'traditional commuting hours' especially for subscribers, this could point to the idea that Ctibike users see it as an effective alternative to the use of subways and other shared forms of transportation. Locations of usage seem to be heavier in areas of higher population density as well as areas of higher business density; particularly Manhattan sees much more usage of the bikesharing program. 
##**Suggested Additional Analyses**
    It would be interesting to run analyses with the same measures on different portions of the year, with an emphasis on weather patterns and temperature changes to see how these variables affect usage of the bikesharing program. I believe we could find value in seeing how holidays and other special events affect usage. It might as well be beneficial to look into the descrepencies we see with birth years and whether those birth years seeing the discrepencies are populated more with subcribers or customers. It would make sense that some customers entered incorrect birth years by mistake  when checking out a bike, and didn't bother to correct their mistaken information.
